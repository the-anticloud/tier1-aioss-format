> AIOSS is a tamper-evident, SHA3-256 hash-chained ledger format for auditing AI interactions, compliance records, and system diagnostics. It provides cryptographic proof that data hasn't been altered, with support for 8 compliance frameworks (SOC2, FedRAMP, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act, UAE AI Act, SPASA).

## What this project is

AIOSS is a tamper-evident, SHA3-256 hash-chained ledger format for auditing AI interactions, compliance records, and system diagnostics. It provides cryptographic proof that data hasn't been altered, with support for 8 compliance frameworks (SOC2, FedRAMP, ISO27001, GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act, UAE AI Act, SPASA).

**Scope honesty:** no model decoding path ships in this project. It is a deterministic/offline component with AIOSS-style audit wiring. PAX may call it as a tool; no inference is claimed here.

Every row above is quoted from a results file in this project that carries its own run provenance. Values without provenance are not published.

### Metric ledger status

Rebuilt from this project's own metric ledger. Documented-but-unverified figures are deliberately dropped; nothing below is inferred.

```csv
